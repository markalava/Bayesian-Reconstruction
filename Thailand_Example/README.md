Two Sex Bayesian Reconstruction for Thailand

# Description #

Two-sex population reconstruction for the population of Thailand as described in the paper "Bayesian reconstruction of two-sex populations by age: estimating sex ratios at birth and sex ratios of mortality".

This repository contains the R code and data needed to reconstruct the population of Thailand, as described in Wheldon et al. (2015). Results directories are empty; run the code to fill them with results. 

# Instructions #

Run the R scripts in the order indicated by their filenames. Scripts that have the same number can be run in parallel. 

The default number of iterations in 1_estimation.R and 2_sample_from_prior.R are much smaller than what is needed, but are set that way to provide example output.
